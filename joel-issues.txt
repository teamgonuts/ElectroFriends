10. Style user Scores
18. Fade open/close for songs in rankings
19. Have score on maxed song line up with the other scores (far right of row), and have up/down vote buttons above and below it. (See picture in facebook message)
20. Somehow need to show that you can click certains pieces of text (ex. Genre in the song's info) aka style links
21. Upload box: line up archive song checkbox next to text instead of below. Currently works in Chrome but not firefox
22. When I paste a long url into the uploads it moves the screen write a cuts off some of the boxes
23. Fix logo on max queue. Needs to be centered and placed on top of a black background. Also, on the reflected version of the logo it looks like there is a gray box behind it
24. Max-queue shouldn't overlap bottom contorls (ie the height should be 100% of the page minus the height of the bottom controls) example: http://i.imgur.com/MI0AQ.png
